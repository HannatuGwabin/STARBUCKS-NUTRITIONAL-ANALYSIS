# INSIGHTS and RECOMMENDATIONS

Tazo Tea and Espresso are the lowest-calorie beverages. I would recommend that people go with drinks with fewer calories to reduce the risk of diabetes and obesity.

Coffee and White Chocolate Mocha (without whipped cream) are the top 2 high carbohydrate beverages. I would recommend these beverages because high-carbohydrate beverages can improve well-being.

Shaken Iced Tazo Tea Lemonade (with classic syrup) and Tazo Tea are the lowest-fat beverages. I would recommend these beverages because low-fat beverages are healthy and nutritious.

White Chocolate Mocha (without whipped cream) and Hot Chocolate (without whipped cream) are the two top beverages with high protein. I would recommend these beverages because beverages with high protein are quite filling and good for overall health maintenance and nutrition support.
